# Survival-Analysis

Survival analysis has emerged as a crucial statistical tool for analyzing time-to-event data,
providing insights into the longevity and retention patterns across various domains, including
employee attrition. This project employs survival analysis to investigate the duration
employees remain with a company before potentially exiting, utilizing the Kaplan-Meier
Fitter and Cox Proportional Hazards Model. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset with
multiple covariates, we identify key periods and factors that influence employee tenure. The
survival functions were calculated for different demographic and job-related variables, such
as job involvement and work-life balance, to assess their impact on retention. The study
highlights how variations in these factors correlate with significant differences in attrition
rates, offering strategic insights for human resources to enhance employee retention and
satisfaction. Overall, this project demonstrates the power of survival analysis in providing
actionable insights into employee retention strategies and the dynamics of workforce stability.
